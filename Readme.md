# Sass Intro

## What is Sass?

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. It provides mechanisms such as variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier to maintain and extend stylesheets. A new syntax, SCSS, was released in 2006, This syntax is a superset of CSS3's syntax, and is also more readable and easier to learn than the original syntax, which uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.

## Why use Sass?

Sass is a powerful tool that helps you write CSS faster with more flexibility. It is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS and compiles it into standard CSS. Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. It is a great tool for web developers who want to simplify their workflow. Sass allows you to use variables, nested rules, and mixins, among other features. It also helps you write cleaner and more organized code. Sass is easy to learn and use, and it can save you a lot of time and effort.

## How to use Sass?

To use Sass, you need to install it on your computer. You can install Sass using npm, Ruby, or other package managers. Once you have installed Sass, you can start using it in your projects. You can create a new Sass file and write your styles in it. You can then compile the Sass file into CSS using the Sass compiler. You can also watch the Sass file for changes and automatically compile it into CSS whenever you make changes to the file. Sass is a powerful tool that can help you write CSS faster and more efficiently.

### Install Sass with npm

To install Sass with npm, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can install Node.js from the official website. Once you have installed Node.js, you can install Sass using npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install -g sass
```

This will install Sass globally on your computer. You can now use Sass in your projects.

### Compile Sass to CSS

Create a file named styles.scss and write your styles in it. You can then compile the Sass file into CSS using the following command:

```
sass styles.scss styles.css
```

This will compile the Sass file into CSS and create a new file named styles.css. You can link the styles.css file to your HTML file to apply the styles to your website.

If you want live compilation, you can watch the Sass file for changes and automatically compile it into CSS whenever you make changes to the file. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sass --watch styles.scss styles.css
```
